SonicMuse — Speech-Aware AI Background Music Generator
Goal
- Build a full‑stack app that takes a speech audio track and generates properly overlaid AI background music that fits the dialogue's pacing and mood.
- Host the web app online and connect to a GPU-enabled backend via simple APIs.
- Stretch: support script‑text → background music with customization, optionally using Google Gemini.

Deliverables
- Frontend SPA with upload, analysis preview, controls, and downloadable mixed audio.
- Backend API with speech analysis, prompt building, music generation, and mixing.
- Deployed site + API with HTTPS.
- Optional text‑script mode with mood timeline editor.

Key Constraints
- Keep inference fast and reproducible.
- No training required; use pretrained models.
- Exact stack and versions pinned.
